# Setting Up SnappyData ODBC Driver and Tableau Desktop

<ent>This feature is available only in the Enterprise version of SnappyData. </br></ent>

!!! Note
	* This is currently tested and supported only on Windows 10 (32-bit and 64-bit systems).

    * [Download and Install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=40784) 

## Step 1: Install the SnappyData ODBC Driver

1. [Download the SnappyData 1.0.2.1 Enterprise Edition](install.md#download-snappydata).

2. Click **ODBC INSTALLERS** to download the **snappydata-odbc-1.0.0.zip** file.

3. Follow [steps 1 and 2](howto/connect_using_odbc_driver.md) to install the  SnappyData ODBC driver.

## Step 2: Create SnappyData DSN from ODBC Data Sources 64-bit/32-bit

To create SnappyData DSN from ODBC Data Sources:

1. Open the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** window:

	a. On the **Start** page, type ODBC Data Sources, and select **Set up ODBC data sources** from the list or select **ODBC Data Sources** in the **Administrative Tools**.

	b. Based on your Windows installation, open **ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)** or **ODBC Data Sources (32-bit)**

2. In the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** window, select either the **User DSN** or **System DSN** tab. 

3. Click **Add** to view the list of installed ODBC drivers on your machine.

4. From the list of drivers, select **SnappyData ODBC Driver** and click **Finish**.

5. The **SnappyData ODBC Configuration** dialog is displayed. </br>Enter the following details to create a DSN:

	* **Data Source Name**: Name of the Data Source. For example, *snappydsn*.  

	* **Server (Hostname or IP)**: IP address of the data server which is running in the SnappyData cluster.

	* **Port**: Port number of the server. By default, it is **1528** for the first data server in the cluster, if all the nodes in the cluster are started on the same machine.

	!!!Note
		ODBC driver cannot connect to the locator and must connect directly to one of the servers. Therefore, in cases where you start a cluster with multiple nodes on different machines and if the server and locator are collocated on a specific machine, then the port number of the server would be higher than that of the locator port which will be 1528. In case the locator is not collocated with the server on a machine then the server port will be 1527.

	* **Login ID**: The login ID required to connect to the server. For example, *app*

	* **Password**: The password required to connect to the server. For example, *app*

!!! Note
	Ensure that you provide the IP Address/Host Name and Port number of the data server. If you provide the details of the locator, the connection fails. 

## Step 3. Install Tableau Desktop (10.1 or Higher)

To install Tableau desktop:

1. [Download Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).

2. Depending on your Windows installation, download the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the installer.

3. Follow the steps to complete the installation and ensure that you register and activate your product.

## Step 4. Connecting Tableau Desktop to SnappyData Server

When using Tableau with the SnappyData ODBC Driver for the first time, you must add the **odbc-snappydata.tdc** file, that is available in the downloaded **snappydata-odbc-1.0.0.zip**.

To connect the Tableau Desktop to the SnappyData Server:

1. Copy the **odbc-snappydata.tdc** file to the <_User_Home_Path_>/Documents/My Tableau Repository/Datasources directory.

2. Open the Tableau Desktop application.

3. On the Start Page,

	a. Under **Connect** > **To a Server**, click **Other Databases (ODBC)**. The Other Databases (ODBC) window is displayed.

	b. In the DSN drop-down list, select the name that you provided for your SnappyData ODBC connection (for example *snappydsn*), and then click **Connect**.

4. When connection to the SnappyData server is established, the **Sign In** option is enabled. Click **Sign In** to log into Tableau.

5. From the **Schema** drop-down list, select a schema. For example, *app*. </br>All tables from the selected schema are listed.

6. Select the required table(s) and drag it to the canvas. A view generated using the selected tables is displayed. </br>If you make changes to the table, click **Update Now** to refresh and view your changes.

7. In the **Worksheets** tab, click **sheet** to start the analysis.</br> 

8. On this screen, you can click and drag a field from the **Dimensions** area to **Rows** or **Columns**.</br> Refer to the Tableau documentation for more information on data visualization.
