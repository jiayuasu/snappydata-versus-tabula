# Data Types
The SQL type system determines the compile-time and runtime type of an expression. Each type has a certain range of permissible values that can be assigned to a column or value of that type.

The special value NULL, denotes an unassigned or missing value of any of the types (columns that have been assigned as non-nullable using NOT NULL clause or the primary key columns cannot have a NULL value). The supported types are given below:

<a href="bigint"></a>
## BIGINT

Provides 8 bytes storage for long integer values. An attempt to put a BIGINT value into another exact numeric type with smaller size/precision (e.g. INT) fails if the value overflows the maximum allowable by the smaller type.

For behavior with other types in expressions, see [Numeric type](#numeric) promotion in expressions, Storing values of one numeric data type in columns of another numeric data type.

<a href="date"></a>
## DATE
**Description** </br>
Provides for storage of a date as year-month-day. Supported formats are: `yyyy-mm-dd`, `mm/dd/yyyy`, and `dd.mm.yyyy`</br>
The year (yyyy) must always be expressed with four digits, while months (mm) and days (dd) may have either one or two digits. DATEs, TIMEs, and TIMESTAMPs must not be mixed with one another in expressions except with an explicit CAST.

**Field Details** </br>
`public static final DataType DATE`
Gets the DateType object.

<a href="decimal"></a>
## DECIMAL
**Description** </br>
Provides an exact decimal value having a specified precision and scale. The precision is the total number of digits both to the left and the right of the decimal point, and the scale is the number of digits in the fraction to the right of the decimal point.</br>
A numeric value (e.g. INT, BIGINT, SMALLINT) can be put into a DECIMAL as long as non-fractional precision is not lost else a range exception is thrown (SQLState: "22003"). When truncating trailing digits from a DECIMAL, the value is rounded down.</br>
For behavior with other types in expressions, see Numeric type promotion in expressions, Scale for decimal arithmetic and Storing values of one numeric data type in columns of another numeric data type.

`public static final DataType DECIMAL`

<a href="double"></a>
## DOUBLE
**Description** </br>
Provides 8-byte storage for numbers using IEEE floating-point notation.</br> 
Arithmetic operations do not round their resulting values to zero. If the values are too small, you will receive an exception. Numeric floating point constants are limited to a length of 30 characters.</br>
For behavior with other types in expressions, see Numeric type promotion in expressions, and Storing values of one numeric data type in columns of another numeric data type.

**Field Details** </br>
`public static final DataType DOUBLE`
Gets the DoubleType object.

<a href="float"></a>
## FLOAT
**Description** </br>

`public static final DataType NUMERIC`

<a href="real"></a>
## REAL
**Description** </br>
Provides 4-byte storage for numbers using IEEE floating-point notation.</br>
Arithmetic operations do not round their resulting values to zero. If the values are too small, you will receive an exception. Constants always map to DOUBLE â€“ use an explicit CAST to convert a constant to REAL.</br>
For behavior with other types in expressions, see Numeric type promotion in expressions, Storing values of one numeric data type in columns of another numeric data type.

**Field Details** </br>
`public static final DataType REAL`

<a href="short"></a>
## SHORT
**Description** </br>
The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive). As with byte, the same guidelines apply: you can use a short to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters.

<a href="smallint"></a>
## SMALLINT
**Description** </br>
Provides 2 bytes storage for short integer values.</br>
For behavior with other types in expressions, see Numeric type promotion in expressions, and Storing values of one numeric data type in columns of another numeric data type.

**Field Details** </br>
`public static final DataType SMALLINT`

<a href="string"></a>
## STRING
The string type is used for storing text strings. A text string is a sequence of characters in the Unicode format with the final zero at the end of it. A string constant can be assigned to a string variable. A string constant is a sequence of Unicode characters enclosed in quotes or double quotes: "This is a string constant".</br>
To include a double quote (") into a string, the backslash character (\) must be put before it. The \ (backslash character) is used to escape characters. Any special character constants can be written in a string, if the backslash character (\) is typed before them.

**Field Details** </br>
`public static final DataType StringType`
Gets the StringType object.

<a href="timestamp"></a>
## TIMESTAMP
**Description** </br>
Provides for storage of both DATE and TIME as a combined value. In addition it allows for fractional seconds having up to six digits. Supported formats are:</br>

- yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnn] 
- yyyy-MM-dd-hh.mm.ss[.nnnnnn] 

The year (yyyy) must always be expressed with four digits. Months (MM), days (dd), and hours (hh) may have one or two digits while minutes (mm) and seconds (ss) must have two digits. Microseconds, if present, may have between one and six digits. DATEs, TIMEs, and TIMESTAMPs must not be mixed with one another in expressions except with an explicit CAST.

**Description** </br>
A very small integer. The signed range is -128 to 127. The unsigned range is 0 to 255. 

**Field Details** </br>
`public static final TINYINT`

<a href="varbinary"></a>
## VARBINARY
**Description** </br>
The VARBINARY type is similar to the VARCHAR type, but stores binary byte strings rather than non-binary character strings.</br>
It contains no character set, and comparison and sorting are based on the numeric value of the bytes.</br>

**Field Details** </br>
`public static final DataType VARBINARY`

<a href=""></a>
## VARCHAR
**Description** </br>
Provides for variable-length strings with a maximum limit for length. If a string value is longer than the maximum length, then any trailing blanks are trimmed to make the length same as the maximum length, while an exception is raised if characters other than spaces are required to be truncated. When mixing CHARs and VARCHARs in expressions, the shorter value is padded with spaces to the length of longer string.</br>
The type of a string constant is CHAR, not VARCHAR. To represent a single quotation mark within a string, use two quotation marks:

`VALUES 'visiting John's place' `

The length of VARCHAR is an unsigned integer constant.
