# hostname-for-clients

The IP address or host name that this server/locator sends to the JDBC/ODBC/thrift clients to use for the connection. The default value causes the `client-bind-address` to be given to clients. </br> This value can be different from `client-bind-address` for cases where the servers/locators are behind a NAT firewall (AWS for example) where `client-bind-address` needs to be a private one that gets exposed to clients outside the firewall as a different public address specified by this property. In many cases, this is handled by the hostname translation itself, that is, the hostname used in `client-bind-address` resolves to internal IP address from inside and to the public IP address from outside, but for other cases, this property is required
