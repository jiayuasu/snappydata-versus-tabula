# skip-listeners

## Description

If true, SnappyData does not propagate DML operations to configured DBSynchronizer, AsyncEventListener, or EventCallBack (Writer and Listener) implementations. This is a connection-level property and applies only to DML operations generated by the specific connection that enables the property. 

!!! Note 
	This property does not affect WAN replication using a configured gateway. SnappyData always propagates DML operations to an enabled WAN site. </p>
