# Multiple Language Binding using Thrift Protocol
SnappyData provides support for Apache Thrift protocol which enables users to access the cluster from other languages that are not supported directly by SnappyData.
Thrift allows efficient and reliable communication across programming languages like Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Elixir, Perl and other languages. For more information on Thrift, refer to the [Apache Thrift documentation](https://thrift.apache.org/).

The JDBC driver for SnappyData that uses the `jdbc:snappydata://` URL schema, now uses Thrift for underlying protocol. The older URL scheme for RowStore `jdbc:gemfirexd://` continues to use the deprecated DRDA protocol.

Likewise, locators and servers in SnappyData now default to starting up thrift servers and when started in RowStore mode (`snappy-start-all.sh rowstore`) the DRDA servers are started as before.

To explicitly start a DRDA server in SnappyData, you can use the `-drda-server-address` and `-drda-server-port` options for the **bind address** and **port** respectively. Likewise, to explicitly start a Thrift server in RowStore mode, you can use the `-thrift-server-address` and `-thrift-server-port` options.

Refer to the following documents for information on support provided by SnappyData:</br>

 * [**About SnappyData Thrift**]( https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/blob/branch-0.9/cluster/README-thrift.md): Contains detailed information about the feature and its capabilities.

 * [**The Thrift Interface Definition Language (IDL)**](https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappy-store/blob/branch-1.5.4/gemfirexd/shared/src/main/java/io/snappydata/thrift/common/snappydata.thrift): This is a Thrift interface definition file for the SnappyData service.
