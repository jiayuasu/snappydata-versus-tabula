<heading3>Configuring the Limit for Open Files and Threads/Processes</heading3>

On a Linux system, you can set the limit of open files and thread processes in the **/etc/security/limits.conf** file. 
</br>A minimum of **8192** is recommended for open file descriptors limit and **>128K** is recommended for the number of active threads. 
</br>A typical configuration used for SnappyData servers and leads can appear as follows:

```pre
snappydata          hard    nofile      32768
snappydata          soft    nofile      32768
snappydata          hard    nproc       unlimited
snappydata          soft    nproc       524288
snappydata          hard    sigpending  unlimited
snappydata          soft    sigpending  524288
```
* `snappydata` is the user running SnappyData.

Recent linux distributions using systemd (like RHEL/CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04) require the **NOFILE** limit to be increased in systemd configuration too. Edit **/etc/systemd/system.conf ** as root, search for **#DefaultLimitNOFILE** under the **[Manager] **section. Uncomment and change it to **DefaultLimitNOFILE=32768**. 
Reboot for the above changes to be applied. Confirm that the new limits have been applied in a terminal/ssh window with **"ulimit -a -S"** (soft limits) and **"ulimit -a -H"** (hard limits).
