# Release Notes 

The SnappyData team is pleased to announce the availability of SnappyData version 1.0.0-RC1.

## New Features
* Fully compatible with Apache Spark 2.1.1

* Mutability support for column store (SNAP-1389):

	- UPDATE and DELETE operations are now supported on column tables.

* ALTER TABLE support for row table (SNAP-1326).

* Security Support (available in [enterprise edition](http://www.snappydata.io/download)):  This release introduces cluster security with authentication and authorisation based on LDAP mechanism. Will be extended to other mechanisms in future (SNAP-1656, SNAP-1813).

* Support for setting scheduler pools using the set command.

* Multi-node cluster now boots up quickly as background start of server processes is enabled by default.

* Pulse Console:  SnappyData Pulse has been enhanced to be more useful to both developers and operations personnel (SNAP-1890, SNAP-1792). Improvements include

	- Ability to sort members list based on members type.

	- Added new UI view named SnappyData Member Details Page which includes, among other things, latest logs.

	- Added members Heap and Off-Heap memory usage details along with their storage and execution splits.

* Users can specify streaming batch interval when submitting a stream job via conf/snappy-job.sh (SNAP-1948).

* Row tables now support LONG, SHORT, TINYINT and BYTE datatypes (SNAP-1722).

* The history file for snappy shell has been renamed from .gfxd.history to .snappy.history. You may copy your existing ~/.gfxd.history to ~/.snappy.history to be able to access your historical snappy shell commands.

## Performance Enhancements
* Performance enhancements with dictionary decoder when dictionary is large. (SNAP-1877)

	- Different sessions end up creating different code due to indeterminate statsPredicate ordering. Now using a consistent sort order so that generated code is identical across sessions for the same query.

	- Reduced the size of generated code.

* Indexed cursors in decoders to improve heavily filtered queries (SNAP-1936)

* Performance improvements in Smart Connector mode, specially with queries on tables with wide schema (SNAP-1363, SNAP-1699)

* Several other performance improvements.

## Select bug fixes and performance related fixes
Some of these are included below. For the complete list, see [ReleaseNotes.txt](https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.txt).

* Fixed data inconsistency issues when a new node is joining the cluster and at the same time write operations are going on. (SNAP-1756)

* The product internally does retries on redundant copy of partitions on the event of a node failure (SNAP-1377, SNAP-902)

* Fixed the wrong status of locators on restarts. After cluster restart, snappy-status-all.sh used to show locators in waiting state even when the actual status changed to running (SNAP-1893)

* Fixed the SnappyData Pulse freezing when loading data sets (SNAP-1426)

* More accurate accounting of execution and storage memory (SNAP-1688, SNAP-1798)

* Corrected case-sensitivity handling for query API calls (SNAP-1714)
