# Licensing Model

Users can download the fully functional OSS version or register on the site and download the Enterprise edition for evaluation purposes. Users can deploy the OSS version into production and choose to purchase support subscriptions for the same. This guarantees access to product support teams and any new releases that are delivered including patches, and hotfixes for critical issues with time bound SLAs.</br> The alternative is to deploy the OSS version into production and use the various community channels for support.

The Enterprise edition of the product can be used for evaluation purposes free of charge, but the license expressly prohibits deploying the product into production without acquiring a license subscription from SnappyData. </br>You can reach out to [sales@snappydata.io](mailto:sales@snappydata.io) for more information on purchasing license subscriptions for the product. Subscriptions are priced per core per year with the option to upgrade to premium support if the user desires to do so. Both the open source and enterprise versions can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud. Web based deployment of clusters on AWS and Azure (future support) is available for the product.
